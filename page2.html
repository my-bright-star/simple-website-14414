Fluency is the ability to read quickly and effortlessly and it is an essential component of reading comprehension. 

We can use the acronym CARE to help us think about the different elements of fluency. 

C - stands for comprehension. Fluent readers understand the text they are reading, including the vocabulary.

A - stands for accuracy - the reader is able to decode the words on the page without making mistakes or self correcting when they do

Rate- sounds conversational, not too slow or too fast and can swoop together meaningful phrases

Expression - natural - not like a robot - you may have heard this referred to as porosity

Fluency is measurable. In order to measure fluency, we count words read correctly per minute. Because of this, sometimes teachers and often times students get the idea that fluency is speed reading. We need to make sure as teachers we emphasise accuracy and expression are just as important. You can do this when you give fluency assessments.

How to Give a Quick Fluency Assessment
</h1>
<h2>
    <ol>
<li>
Select a Dibels passage.
</li>
<li>
    Make sure you have one copy for the student to read and one copy for you to mark.
    </li>
<li>
Set a timer for 60 seconds.
</li>
<li>Listen to the student read aloud. 
</li>
<li>On your copy, mark any words that were changed, skipped or caused hesitation. These are the error words. Errors will give you insight into instructional needs.
</li>
<li>You can mark SC over words the student Self Corrected by rereading.
</li>
<li>Mark the last word read when the timer goes off.
</li>
<li>Encourage the student by sharing what they did wellâ€¦ rate, accuracy, expression 


</li><li>Count the words in the selection of the passage that were read and subtract the errors.      This gives you the Words Correct per Minute (WCPM).
</li>
    </ol>
